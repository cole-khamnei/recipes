 - 2.5 lbs boneless chicken thighs in bowl.

- salt
- pepper
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp aleppo pepper or chili flakes
- 1 tbsp garlic power
- 1/2 tbsp chipotle powder
- 1/2 tsp coriander
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp yogurt
- 1 large lime juice
- 1/2 large red onion

- marinate 2-4 hours

3 Mix it super well, then thinly slice 1/2 large red onion and mix it in with the chicken. You ideally let this marinate for 2-4 hrs but if you want to make it right away, you can.



4 When youâ€™re ready to make it, remove the chicken from the fridge and let it come up to room temp before placing it in the oven, about 30 mins. Then preheat your oven to 425F. Pack the marinated chicken tightly inside a loaf pan (my size is roughly 8.5x4.5x2.5). Place in the oven for 50-55 mins at 425F.

5 Remove the chicken from the oven, tilt the pan over a glass bowl or container to pour out the excess juices. I like to pour this over the chicken before serving, or even use it as a broth or base for soups.

6 Flip the pan over a cutting board and cut the chicken into strips, cubes, or whatever shape you like.

7 Then serve it however way you wish.
